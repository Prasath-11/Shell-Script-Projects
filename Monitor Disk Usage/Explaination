COMMAND - [$(df / | grep / | awk '{ print $5 }' | sed 's/%//')]
Explaination :

1, df /:
The df command reports the disk space usage of file systems.
df / specifically checks the disk usage of the root (/) filesystem.

2, grep /:
The grep / command filters the output of the df / command to show only the line that contains the / filesystem.
This is useful in case the df output includes information about multiple filesystems, ensuring only the root filesystem (/) is selected.

3, awk '{ print $5 }':
awk is a powerful text-processing tool that splits input into fields (based on whitespace by default) and allows you to print specific fields.
The { print $5 } part tells awk to print the 5th field from the line, which corresponds to the Use% column.

4, sed 's/%//':
sed is a stream editor used to modify text.
The s/%// part of the sed command is a substitution that removes the percentage symbol (%) from the string.
s/%// means "substitute (s) the % character with nothing (i.e., remove it)."

For example, if awk returns 20%, sed will remove the % symbol and leave just 20.

COMMAND - [echo -e "Subject:${SUBJECT}\n\n${BODY}" | sendmail -v $EMAIL_RECIPIENT]
Explaination :

1, echo -e:
The echo command is used to print text to the terminal (or redirect it elsewhere).
The -e option enables escape sequences, allowing special characters to be interpreted. This includes characters like \n (new line), \t (tab), etc.
In this case, the -e option is used to interpret the newline characters (\n) in the string.

2, "Subject:${SUBJECT}\n\n${BODY}":
This is the string being passed to echo, and it consists of two main parts:
Subject:${SUBJECT}: This part includes the subject of the email. The ${SUBJECT} is a variable that holds the subject text (e.g., "Disk Usage Alert").
\n\n: This represents two newline characters, ensuring that there is a blank line between the subject line and the body of the email.
${BODY}: This is the body of the email, stored in the ${BODY} variable (e.g., "Disk usage has exceeded 80%").

3, | (Pipe):
The pipe (|) takes the output of the command on the left (in this case, echo) and sends it as input to the command on the right (in this case, sendmail).

4, sendmail -v $EMAIL_RECIPIENT:
sendmail is a command-line utility for sending emails from Unix/Linux systems. It allows sending emails via the system's configured mail server.
-v: The -v option stands for verbose mode. It provides detailed output about the process of sending the email, including information about delivery status, any errors, and other details.
$EMAIL_RECIPIENT: This is the recipient's email address, stored in the EMAIL_RECIPIENT variable. For example, this could be "admin@example.com". It tells sendmail who to send the email to.
