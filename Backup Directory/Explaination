COMMAND - [tar -czf "$BACKUP_FILE" -C "$SOURCE_DIR" .]
Explaination:

This line performs the actual backup and compression using the tar command:

tar: The tool used for creating archive files.
-czf: A combination of options:
-c: Create a new archive.
-z: Compress the archive using gzip.
-f: Specify the filename of the archive (in this case, $BACKUP_FILE).
"$BACKUP_FILE": The full path and filename of the backup file.

-C "$SOURCE_DIR": This option tells tar to change the working directory to $SOURCE_DIR before creating the archive. 
This means that the archive will contain the contents of the source directory, but it wonâ€™t include the full path leading to it. 
It will only store the files and directories inside the source directory.

.: This specifies the current directory (after the -C option), meaning it will archive all files and subdirectories within $SOURCE_DIR.
